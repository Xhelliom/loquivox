"""
The pluggable transcription backend interface.

A backend turns recorded audio into text. Backends differ in their *capability*
(batch vs streaming) and their *availability* (a cloud backend needs a key and
network; a local backend needs the model on disk). The dispatcher
(see ``dispatcher.py``) uses ``is_available()`` plus the ``BackendUnavailable``
exception to fall back from a primary (e.g. Groq) to an offline backend
(whisper.cpp) transparently.

Contract for ``transcribe``:
  - return the transcript string, or ``None`` if the audio held no speech.
    ``None`` is a *valid* result — the dispatcher does NOT fall back on it.
  - raise ``BackendUnavailable`` for any operational failure (missing key, no
    network, API/HTTP error, model load failure). That — and only that — is
    what triggers the dispatcher's fallback.
